OpenCV Examples
===============

This github-repo is for my trial of face- and eyedetection and recognition.
The goal is to implement this to run on a RasperryPi Zero W to detect and recognize people
entering my home.

There are some different examples:

1. camera.py - simple code to read video from a camera
2. camera_grey.py - converting the video to greyscale before showing it on the screen
3. camera_facedetect.py - simple face detection to test what is possible and how good it works
4. camera_eyedetect.py - detecting eyes within the face-region


TODO
-------
- Test resizing of images to process the pictures faster
- Adjust parameters for face- and eyedetection to improve stability
